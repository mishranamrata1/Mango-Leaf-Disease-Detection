# Mango-Leaf-Disease-Detection
Welcome to the Mango Leaf Disease Detection Model repository! This project focuses on the development of a machine learning model for predicting the diseases affecting mango leaves based on their images. The goal is to identify diseases in mango trees more effectively.

Model Overview
The Mango Leaf Disease Detection Model is designed to classify images of mango leaves into different disease categories. Leveraging machine learning techniques, the model has been trained on a curated dataset containing images of mango leaves with various diseases and a class for healthy leaves.

Dataset
The model was trained and evaluated on the Mango Leaf Disease Detection Dataset. The dataset includes high-resolution images of mango leaves, each labeled with the specific disease or marked as healthy.
Data is also provided in the folder.

Model Architecture
The model architecture is based on state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and a dense classifier for disease classification. The training process involved fine-tuning the model on the specific characteristics of mango leaf diseases.

Accuracy: 96%
